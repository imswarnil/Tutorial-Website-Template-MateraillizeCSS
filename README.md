# Online Tutorial Website Kit Using MateriallizeCSS

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

This Is Static website created using MaterializeCSS, I have created this site in such a way so that if any one planning to create his own tutorial for others
you just need to enter your Content In HTML pages and your tutorial is ready to serve for your audience.

### AIM OF CREATING THIS PROJECT

I have seen people who having good technical side , but they are not good into web development/UI , to give you clear picture if any geek who is master in SQL and he wants
to create tutorial he is good in SQL but to create good tutorial site you have to rely on wordpress themes or some other options, i have created this site using materiallizeCSS so 
that it will look good and easy to use for any developer working in any domain.
